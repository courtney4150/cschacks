Our CSC Hacks Competition Entry
Participants: Benjamin Solomon  Courtney Sheridan   Eesha Mukherjee

Our goal:
Make a platform with fun activities that can improve people's moods/mental wellbeing during covid and beyond

Many of us don't have as many social interactions as we used to. Many of us have had our plans cancelled time and time again. Many of us live in fear of our loved ones falling ill. 
All together, it's been an extremely stressful time, so we created this website to help! 
We have many activities you can participate in, such as Pen Pals, Wellness Poll, Friend Matching, and a Positive News Page (some features coming soon). 

Have a look around! You can find the website at: https://courtney4150.github.io/cschacks/
