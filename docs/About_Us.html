        <u>Our CSC Hacks Competition Entry</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Participants: Benjamin Solomon,  Courtney Sheridan,   Eesha Mukherjee
      </p>

      <h3>
        Our goal
      </h3>
      <p>
        Make a platform with fun activities that can improve people's moods/mental wellbeing during covid and beyond
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of us don't have as many social interactions as we used to. Many of us have had our plans cancelled time and time again. Many of us live in fear of our loved ones falling ill. 
        All together, it's been an extremely stressful time, so we created this website to help! 
        We have many activities you can participate in, such as Pen Pals, Wellness Poll, Friend Matching, and a Positive News Page (some features coming soon). 
      </p>

      <h3>
        Who we are
      </h3>
      <p>
        Super cool programming sorcerers here to blow your mind with our epic techno-wizardry! But in all honesty, 
        none of us had experience making a website before so it was all a learning experience.
