    <h2>Why Mental Health?</h2>
    <p>Humans are inherently social creatures. Numerous scientific studies have shown that insufficient human interaction can lead to poor mental health. Yet, right now, most of us arenâ€™t getting nearly enough social interactions. A team of students from SCI at Pitt decided to try their hand at improving the situation through the power of technology.  This website is designed to help everyone improve their mental wellbeing, and I hope it improves yours!</p>
